Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.
// RDB = I'd have to be smart and know lots of stuff like C and model theory(beyond this), 
// SQL/RDBMS = Structured Query Language thats used to interact with RDBs is easy mode and help us interact in the basic functionality.
//this question is weird to me, why isn't this like SQL vs noSQL? is this a typo lol?

Why do tables need a primary key?
// to uniquely ID specific rows in a table

What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
// a foreign key reference

What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
//when multiple records in a table are affiliate with multiple records in another table it becomes many to many
//like when customers can purchase products and products can be purchased by many constumers
